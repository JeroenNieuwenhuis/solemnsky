/**
 * Here we define the the 'Arena', a place where multiple players come together

 * has exactly one arena, which stays online during continuous server
 * operation.
 *
 * We allocate a place in the central game engine for this because many of
 * the concepts here are shared amongst client and server implementations, as
 * well as Sky itself.

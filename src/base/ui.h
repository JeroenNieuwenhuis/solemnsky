/**
 * Representations of various UI elements, to integrate into our UI code.
 * Some general guidelines:
 * - We don't use fancy callbacks, just "signals" (variables)
 * - Everything is a Control.
 * - A lot of things that one might be tempted to design per-element can be 
 * designed for all Controls (for example, position-transforming or 
 * time-scaling). Abstraction is good!

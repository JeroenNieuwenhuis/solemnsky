# Client

The client is the tool a player uses to ultimately interact with a multiplayer game.
 It should provide information to them clearly, allow them to alter settings, join a
 game, and then get out of their noses. Simple!

solemnsky uses its own tiny (think ~2000 LOC) UI framework, defined in the `ui` namespace,
 to describe its GUI in a sane way. The client builds on this framework, defining a
 structured hierarchy of interfaces to represent the various elements of the client.

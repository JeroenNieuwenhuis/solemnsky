# solemnsky technical documentation

Welcome to the solemnsky technical documentation. This directory aims to give an 
 up-to-date overview of the solemnsky project to developers.

## Building

It's possible to build this project on most Windows, OSX, and Linux setups. 
Listed below are the particular setups that we test against.

 * Windows: install http://nuwen.net/mingw.html -style MinGW, build with CLion.
 * OSX: Install Boost (homebrew works fine), and CMake to Xcode projects. You can build those.
 * Linux: Should build easily, if you're having problems nix is a sure-fire way 
to not have problems anymore (see default.nix in top-level).

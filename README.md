# solemnsky
 
[Altitude](http://altitudegame.com) demonstrated the viability of an uncommon genera 
 of multiplayer game. Beyond its cartoonish appearance, it offered a competitive 
 multiplayer experience that kept a small dedicated player-base coming back year after year.

However, it does suffer some unfortunate limitations and in recent years has become
 increasingly stagnant. Cue solemnsky: the second attempt at an altitude-like game.
 We aim to make a new altitude that exposes itself to community development and addresses
 altitude's old problems from a different light.

solemnsky is not an altitude clone; it's a new look at what made altitude great.

## Technical Documentation

Solemnsky is in active development. See the top-level `docs/` directory for an overview

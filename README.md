# solemnsky
 
[Altitude](http://altitudegame.com) demonstrated the viability of an uncommon genera 
 of multiplayer game. Despite its cartoonish appearance, it offered a competitive 
 multiplayer experience that kept a small dedicated player-base coming back year after year.

However, it suffers some unfortunate limitations and in recent years has become
 increasingly stagnant. Cue solemnsky: a new altitude -- an al2itude, if you will -- that 
 exposes itself to community development and addresses its predecessor's old problems with 
 a new light.

Welcome to solemnsky: the open-source competitive multiplayer 2d plane game.

## Technical Documentation

solemnsky is in active development. See the top-level `docs/` directory for an overview
 into the technical design and current status of our continuing efforts to build the best
 "alti2ude" we can manage.

## You Can Help!

There are a lot of roles to fill on our team! Whether you want to contribute or just 
 drop by and say hi, contact Chris Gadzinski (MagneticDuck) via 
 [email](mailto:zenmags@gmail.com) or via skype (magnetic.duck); we'll get up set up
 on our slack group along with the rest of the team.

Some roles we'd particularly like to see filled:
 * Graphic designer.

 * C++ programmer.
 * Web designer.

We're dedicated to pulling this project through; your contributions will be matched.

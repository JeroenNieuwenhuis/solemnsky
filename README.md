# solemnsky
 
[Altitude](http://altitudegame.com) demonstrated the viability of an uncommon genera 
 of multiplayer game. Despite its cartoonish appearance, it offered a competitive 
 experience that kept a small dedicated player-base coming back year after year.

However, it suffers some unfortunate limitations and in recent years has become
 increasingly stagnant. Cue solemnsky: a new altitude -- an alti2ude, if you will -- that 
 exposes itself to community development and addresses its predecessor's old problems with 
 a new light.

This is solemnsky: the open-source competitive multiplayer 2d plane game.

## Technical Documentation

solemnsky is in active development. See the top-level `docs/` directory for an overview
 into the technical design and current status of our continuing efforts to build the best
 "alti2ude" we can manage.

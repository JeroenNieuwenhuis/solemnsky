# SolemnSky

## Building

It's possible to build this project on most Windows, OSX, and Linux setups. 
Listed below are the particular setups that we test against.

Windows: install http://nuwen.net/mingw.html -style MinGW, build with CLion.
OSX: Just Works (tm).
Linux: Should build easily, if you're having problems nix is a sure-fire way 
to not have problems anymore (see default.nix in top-level).

## Roadmap

* Learn C++, get physics and multimedia libraries, build into hello-world on a 
few systems. (Completed.)
* Realise I can't "Learn C++" in one step. (In denial.)
* Write code until we have an offline demo with flight mechanics and graphics
. (Working.)
* Write code until we have a basic multiplayer client / server.
* Make multiplayer not suck.
* Get Lua script evaluation working.
* Etc. etc.
